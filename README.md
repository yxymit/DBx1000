DBx1000
=======

DBx1000 is an single node OLTP database management system (DBMS). The goal of DBx1000 is to make DBMS scalable on future 1000-core processors. We implemented all the seven classic concurrency control schemes in DBx1000. They exhibit different scalability properties under different workloads. 

The concurrency control scalability study is described in the following paper.

Build & Test
------------

To build the database.

    make deps
    make -j

To test the database

    python test.py
    
Configuration
-------------

DBMS configurations can be changed in the config.h file. Please refer to README for the meaning of each configuration. Here we only list several most important ones. 

    THREAD_CNT        : Number of worker threads running in the database.
    WORKLOAD          : Supported workloads include YCSB, TPCC and TEST (for testing)
    CC_ALG            : Concurrency control algorithm. Seven algorithms are supported 
                        (DL_DETECT, NO_WAIT, WAIT_DIE, TIMESTAMP, MVCC, OCC, HSTORE) 
    MAX_TXN_PER_PART  : Number of transactions to run per thread per partition.
                        
Configurations can also be specified as command argument at runtime. Run the following command for a full list of program argument. 
    
    ./rundb -h

Run
---

The DBMS can be run with 

    ./rundb
